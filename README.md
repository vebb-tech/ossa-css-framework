# ossa
## A Simple CSS Framework

Ossa is the latin word for bones and is meant to describe the purpose of this framework.
This is not a end all be all CSS framework but a simple starter to any new project, the _skeleton_ if you will.

The project is split into several SCSS files which you can chooses to remove as you please.
It also comes with a basic CSS reset.
