# ossa
## A Simple CSS Framework

Ossa is the latin word for bones and that was chosen to set the tone of this framework.
This is not a end all be all CSS framework but a simple starter to any new project.

The project is split into several SCSS files which you can chooses to remove as you please.
It also comes with a basic CSS reset.
